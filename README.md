# Material-Material Link Sets

This repository will contain formal link sets, using the specifications developed in the Open PHACTS project
to link (nano)materials between databases/repositories, given some level of identity. The specification
has a formal mechanism to specify what the justification is for linking them. This approach is referred to
as scientific lenses.
